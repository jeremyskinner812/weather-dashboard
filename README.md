# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

The motivation for this application was to build an app that utilizes Open Weather Map's API to generate current and future weather conditions for any given searched area. I built this to practice generating HTML elements using javascript and utilize a web API to get information based on a user's query. It solves the problem of being able to get up-to-date information on the day's weather and future conditions so a user can plan their life accordingly based on the forecasts. I learned how to utilize different API requests and parse through the responses to generate content that can be seen and interacted with on the page.
